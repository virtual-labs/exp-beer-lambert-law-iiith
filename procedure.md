## Step-by-Step Procedure

### Step 1: Solution Preparation
1. **Prepare Stock Solution**: Create a standard K₂Cr₂O₇ solution with concentration approximately 3.16 × 10⁻³ M.
2. **Prepare Dilutions**: From the stock solution, prepare six different concentrations of K₂Cr₂O₇ using the following volume ratios:
   - **Solution 1**: 0.5 mL K₂Cr₂O₇ : 9.5 mL water
   - **Solution 2**: 1.0 mL K₂Cr₂O₇ : 9.0 mL water
   - **Solution 3**: 1.5 mL K₂Cr₂O₇ : 8.5 mL water
   - **Solution 4**: 2.0 mL K₂Cr₂O₇ : 8.0 mL water
   - **Solution 5**: 2.5 mL K₂Cr₂O₇ : 7.5 mL water
   
   **Note**: Calculate the molar concentrations of these solutions before proceeding with measurements.

### Step 2: Instrument Setup
3. **Power On**: Turn on the spectrophotometer by clicking the power button.
4. **Initialization**: Wait for 30 minutes for proper instrument initialization.

### Step 3: Concentration Selection
5. **Select Concentration**: Click and drag on the concentration bar to choose the appropriate concentration.
   - **Important**: Start with the lowest concentration solution first.
   - **Why start with lowest concentration?** This helps establish a baseline and ensures proper instrument calibration.

### Step 4: Sample Preparation
6. **Obtain Beaker**: Click on the beaker to take a clean, dry beaker.
7. **Transfer Solution**: Click on the volumetric flask to pour the solution into the clean, dry beaker.
8. **Collect Sample**: Click on the micropipette to collect the appropriate quantity of solution from the beaker.
9. **Prepare Cuvette**: Take a quartz cuvette (1 cm path length) by clicking on it.
10. **Fill Cuvette**: Pour the solution from the micropipette into the cuvette by clicking on the micropipette.
    - **Note**: In real measurements, fill the cuvette to two-thirds of its volume.

### Step 5: Spectrophotometer Operation
11. **Open Instrument**: Click on the spectrophotometer lid to open it.
12. **Place Sample**: Click on the cuvette to place it in the sample holder.
    - **Reference Setup**: Use water as the sample blank/reference in an identical cuvette.
    - **Double Beam Setup**: For double beam spectrophotometers, place the sample in the front holder and reference in the back holder simultaneously.

### Step 6: Wavelength Scan
13. **Initiate Scan**: 
    - Click on the computer monitor first
    - Then click on the Scan button to observe the wavelength scan
14. **Scan Parameters**: 
    - Choose appropriate wavelength range for incident light
    - Run scan in absorbance or transmittance mode
    - Data is automatically stored in the computer
15. **Single Beam Considerations**: If using a single beam instrument:
    - First run scan with sample blank/reference
    - Then run scan with sample
    - Subtract reference data from sample data for respective wavelengths

### Step 7: Data Collection
16. **Reset**: Click on Reset button to start new measurement.
17. **Repeat Measurements**: 
    - Select next higher concentration
    - Repeat the measurement process
    - **Important**: Rinse the cuvette with a small portion of the next solution before each measurement
    - Continue for all concentrations sequentially
18. **Collect Data**: Click on the Data tab to collect all experimental data.

### Step 8: Data Analysis
19. **Plot Absorbance Spectra**: Plot absorbance vs. wavelength for different concentrations to determine spectral peak positions.
20. **Identify λ_max**: Find the wavelength of maximum absorbance (λ_max) for all concentrations.
21. **Create Data Table**: Compile absorbance data at λ_max and at another wavelength (e.g., 335 nm) for all concentrations.

## Experimental Data

### Table 1: Absorbance Values for Different Concentrations of K₂Cr₂O₇

**Note**: The values in the table are theoretical and may vary slightly in actual measurements due to experimental conditions and instrument calibration. The absorbance values follow the Beer-Lambert law, showing a linear relationship with concentration at both wavelengths.

### Step 9: Verification and Analysis
22. **Plot Calibration Curve**: Plot absorbance vs. concentration.
    - Connect points with line segments
    - Perform linear regression analysis
    - Calculate correlation coefficient
23. **Verify Beer-Lambert Law**: 
    - Observe whether absorbance values show linear correlation with concentration
    - Analyze transmittance values
    - Discuss results and deviations from linearity

2. **Wavelength Selection**: Measure at absorbance maxima (λ_max)
3. **Light Source**: Use monochromatic light for accurate measurements
4. **Temperature Control**: Maintain constant temperature throughout measurements
5. **Cuvette Care**: Use clean, matched cuvettes
