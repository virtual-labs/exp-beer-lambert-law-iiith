The main objectives of this experiment are:

1. To verify the linearity of Beer-Lambert law by studying the relationship between absorbance and concentration
2. To determine the molar absorptivity (ε) of K₂Cr₂O₇ solution at different wavelengths
3. To understand the practical applications and limitations of Beer-Lambert law in spectroscopic analysis
4. To learn the proper techniques of using a spectrophotometer for absorbance measurements
