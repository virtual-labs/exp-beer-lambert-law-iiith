In absorption spectrometry, the intensity of transmitted radiation decreases based on two key factors: the path length through the sample and the concentration of the absorbing species. The Beer-Lambert law quantitatively describes this relationship and is fundamental to understanding absorption spectroscopy.

The main objectives of this experiment are:

1. To verify the linearity of Beer-Lambert law by studying the relationship between absorbance and concentration
2. To determine the molar absorptivity (ε) of K₂Cr₂O₇ solution at different wavelengths
3. To understand the practical applications and limitations of Beer-Lambert law in spectroscopic analysis
4. To learn the proper techniques of using a spectrophotometer for absorbance measurements
